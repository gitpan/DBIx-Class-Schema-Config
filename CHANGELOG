0.1.2
    - Makefile.PL depends on DBD::SQLite not DBD::SQLite3
    - _make_config has a less annoying return
    - connection() no longer tries to block ->load_credentials,
      it is load_credential's responsablity to to check for credentials
      it should allow to fall through.
    - Added accessor on_credential_load, it provides access to the config
      structure that load_credentials creates, and expects it as the return.
      It can be used to make changes to the credentials, such as decrypting
      passwords from the config file.
    - A new Schema base was created for testing on_credential_load
    - New tests added for on_credential_load
0.1.1:
    - Replace SUPER:: with next::method
    - Don't call load_credentials unless we're actually going to load some
    - Move Config::Any into load_credentials to be lazy
    - Allow handling of a normal hashref, no ->{options} (Should make handling cleaner)
    - Add Testing schema for integration tests

0.1.0:
    - Inital Version
